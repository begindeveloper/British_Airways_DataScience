#[Task 2: Build a predictive model for the data to influence buying behaviour]
* Prepare a dataset
* Train a machine learning model
* Evaluate and present your findings
* Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour

Visualizations for Task 2:

I was able to build and visualize the data required to help British Airways facilitate a better systems and processes. In most cases, this could help an airline discover where they make the most profits and how they can better serve their passengers.
